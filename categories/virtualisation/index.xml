      <title>Deploying virtual baremetal with Ironic &amp; Kolla</title>

      <description>A common barrier to entry when looking to try out OpenStack Ironic is that you need a baremetal machine to use with it. It turns out that it is possible to use a virtual machine in lieu of baremetal, and this is exactly what tools such as devstack and tripleo allow for. This guide details how the same setup can be done using Kolla. Given the complexity of Ironic and the variety of configurations possible, almost every step will have a multitude of variations and possibilities, I just detail what worked for me.</description>

      <description>As part of efforts to more regularly test the Xen hypervisor with Nova as part of OpenStack development, I&amp;rsquo;m spending some time figuring out how to virtualise Xen on Xen, specifically Oracle&amp;rsquo;s Oracle VM Server.
In virtualisation terms the different levels of hypervisor are referred to as LN, where N is the nesting level. In our setup, Oracle VM Server 3.4.2 (OVM-S) is running on baremetal as L0, another instance of OVM-S is running on that as L1, and the final OpenStack instantiated guest would be L2.</description>
